# DVD Rental Data Set Description

Three business related case studies were undertaken as part of the course work for Udemy's SQL Bootcamp course.  

Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Definition Language (DDL) queries in PostGreSQL, MySQL and SAS/SQL to query three relational databases for the purposes of Data Extraction, Data Analysis, creation and restoration of Schemas.
