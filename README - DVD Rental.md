# DVD Rental Data Set Description

Three business related case studies were undertaken as part of the course work for Udemy's SQL Bootcamp course.  

Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Definition Language (DDL) queries in PostGreSQL were used to query three relational databases for the purposes of Data Extraction, Data Analysis, creation and restoration of Schemas. 

The first data set is the data base of a DVD rental store. 

There are 15 tables in the DVD Rental database:

1. actor – stores actors data including first name and last name.
2. film – stores films data such as title, release year, length, rating, etc.
3. film_actor – stores the relationships between films and actors.
4. category – stores film’s categories data.
5. film_category- stores the relationships between films and categories.
6. store – contains the stores data including manager staff and address.
7. inventory – stores inventory data.
